# `group_by` and `summarise`


## The Happy data from GSS

The General Social Survey (GSS) has been run by NORC every other year since 1972 to keep track of current opinions across the United States. 

An excerpt of the GSS data called `happy` is available from the `classdata` package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("heike/classdata")
```

You can find a codebook with explanations for each of the variables at https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/

## A first look

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(classdata)
data("happy", package="classdata")
happy %>% str()
```

## The variable `HAPPY`

```{r}
happy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = happy)) + geom_bar()
```


## The variable `age`

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}
happy %>% ggplot(aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
```

## The variable `degree`

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height = 3.5}
happy %>% ggplot(aes(x = degree)) + geom_bar()
```


## Summarising Happiness

Use scores for `happy` factor to summarise overall happiness level, i.e. `not too happy` = 1, `pretty happy` = 2, and `very happy` = 3

```{r}
happy %>% summarise(
  m.happy = mean(as.numeric(happy), na.rm=TRUE)
  )
```
```{r}
happy %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(
  m.happy = mean(as.numeric(happy), na.rm=TRUE)
  )
```

## Your turn: group_by and summarise {.white}

<span style="color:white">For this your turn use the `happy` data from the `classdata` package </span>

- <span style="color:white">How do average happiness levels change over age?</span>
- <span style="color:white">Are Republicans or Democrats happier? Compare average happiness levels over `partyid`.</span>
- <span style="color:white">How are financial relations associated with average happiness levels? Is this association different for men and women?</span><br><br>
- <span style="color:white">Find a plot that shows the differences for each one of the summaries.</span>

## Your turn: asking questions {.white}

## Helper functions (1)

- `n()` provides the number of rows of a subset:
```{r}
happy %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(n = n())
```
- `tally()` is a combination of `summarise` and `n`
```{r}
happy %>% group_by(sex) %>% tally()
```

## Helper functions (2)

- `count()` is a further shortcut of `group_by` and `tally`:
```{r}
happy %>% count(sex, degree)
```
