## Data management in R: the tidyverse 

<img src="images/tidyverse.jpeg" alt="" width=600>


## Outline

- elements of data management: filtering, sorting, and aggregations
- the pipe operator `%>%`
- lots of examples

## `tidyverse`

`tidyverse` is a package bundling several other R packages:

- `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, ...
- share common data representations and API, i.e. work well together
- see https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse for more information

Summaries

- numerical summaries - [elements]() of `dplyr` and `tidyr`
- graphical summaries - [visualizations]() with `ggplot2`


## `dplyr` 

There are a couple of primary `dplyr` *verbs*, representing distinct data analysis tasks:

- `filter`: Select specified rows of a data frame, produce subsets
- `arrange`: Reorder the rows of a data frame
- `select`: Select particular columns of a data frame
- `mutate`: Add new or change existing columns of the data frame (as functions of existing columns)
- `summarize`: Create collapsed summaries of a data frame
- `group_by`: Introduce structure to a data frame

## Common structure

all functions of the tidyverse have `data` as their first element

Important: do not use `$` notation for variables within these functions, e.g: 

`ggplot(data = fbi, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_point()`


`filter(fbi, Year>=2019, State=="Iowa")`


## The pipe operator `%>%`

`f(x) %>% g(y)` is equivalent to `g(f(x), y)`

i.e. the output of one function is used as input to the next function. This function can be the identity

Consequences:

- `x %>% f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`
- statements of the form `k(h(g(f(x, y), z), u), v, w)` become
`x %>% f(y) %>% g(z) %>% h(u) %>% k(v, w)`
- read `%>%` as "then do"

## Using the pipe `%>%`

```
ggplot(data = filter(fbi, Type=="Murder.and.nonnegligent.Manslaughter", 
aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_point()
```

becomes

```
fbi %>% 
  filter(Type=="Murder.and.nonnegligent.Manslaughter") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + 
    geom_point()
```

## `filter`

select a subset of the observations (horizontal selection):

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(classdata)
library(dplyr)

fbi %>% filter(Type=="Burglary", Year==2014) %>% head()
```



## `arrange`

`arrange` sorts a data set by the values in one or more variables

Successive variables break ties in previous ones

`desc` stands for descending, otherwise rows are sorted from smallest to largest

```{r, message=FALSE}
fbi %>% arrange(desc(Year), Type, desc(Count)) %>% head()
```

## `select`

Select specific variables of a data frame (vertical selection):

```{r}
fbi %>% arrange(desc(Year), Type, desc(Count)) %>%
  select(Type, Count, State, Year) %>% head()
```

## `mutate`

Introduce a new variable into a data set or transform/update an old variable:

```{r}
fbi %>% mutate(Rate = Count/Population*70000) %>% head()
```


## `summarise`



summarize observations into a (set of) one-number statistic(s):


```{r}
fbi %>% 
    summarise(mean_rate = mean(Count/Population*70000, na.rm=TRUE), 
              sd_rate = sd(Count/Population*70000, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## `summarise` and `group_by`

```{r}
fbi %>%
    group_by(Type) %>%
    summarise(mean_rate = mean(Count/Population*70000, na.rm=TRUE), 
              sd_rate = sd(Count/Population*70000, na.rm = TRUE))
```


# Let's use these tools



## French fries data

```{r}
data(french_fries, package="reshape2")
```

- data from sensory experiment conducted at Iowa State University in 2004
- investigators were interested in comparing effects of three different fryer oils on taste of fries

```{r}
french_fries %>% head()
```

## Did the french fries taste worse over time?

> - How do we define 'tasting well'? 
>   - Higher values of potato-y and buttery, lower values of grassy, rancid, painty
> - Compute averages of these scales for each time point
> - combination of `group_by` and `summarise`

## Did the french fries taste worse over time? (2)

```{r}
french_fries %>% group_by(time) %>% summarise(
  m.potato = mean(potato, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.buttery = mean(buttery, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.grassy = mean(grassy, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.rancid = mean(rancid, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.painty = mean(painty, na.rm=TRUE)
) %>% head()
```

## Did the french fries taste worse over time? (3)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

avgs <- french_fries %>% group_by(time) %>% summarise(
  m.potato = mean(potato, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.buttery = mean(buttery, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.grassy = mean(grassy, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.rancid = mean(rancid, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.painty = mean(painty, na.rm=TRUE)
)
```

```{r}
avgs %>% ggplot(aes(x = time)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = m.potato)) +
  geom_point(shape=2, aes(y=m.rancid)) + 
  ylab("Average")
```
