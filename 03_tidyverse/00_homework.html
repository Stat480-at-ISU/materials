<h2>About the homework</h2>
<ul>
<li><del>You can’t start working on the homework before Tuesday, because you don’t know all of the concepts yet</del></li>
<li><del>You need to know commands that were not taught in class in order to solve the homework</del></li>
<li>All homework assignments cover only material up to/including the Thursday when it is posed.</li>
<li>If you think you cannot solve the homework with tools we have covered you have missed something.</li>
<li>“It is hard to figure out what a question asks for” … I agree. Most is intentional, but maybe not all. I will work on that.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Vague question of homework #5</h2>

<p>How is the attitude towards babies on planes shaped by gender and own children under 18?</p>
<p>Find a plot that summarises your findings (use <code>ggplot2</code>).</p>

<h2>About this class</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The bad news is that whenever you learn a new skill you’re going to suck. It’s going to be frustrating. The good news is that this is typical and happens to everyone and it is only temporary. You can’t go from knowing nothing to becoming an expert without going through a period of great frustration and great suckiness.</p>
