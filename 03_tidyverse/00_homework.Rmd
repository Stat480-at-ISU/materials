## About the homework

- ~~You can't start working on the homework before Tuesday, because you don't know all of the concepts yet~~ 
- ~~You need to know commands that were not taught in class in order to solve the homework~~ 
- All homework assignments cover only material up to/including the Thursday when it is posed.
- If you think you cannot solve the homework with tools we have covered you have missed something.
- "It is hard to figure out what a question asks for" ... I agree. Most is intentional, but maybe not all. I will work on that.

## Vague question of homework #5

Investigate the relationship between gender and the variables `Do.you.have.any.children.under.18.` and `baby.on.plane`.

How is the attitude towards babies on planes shaped by gender and own children under 18? 

Find a plot that summarises your findings (use  `ggplot2`).
