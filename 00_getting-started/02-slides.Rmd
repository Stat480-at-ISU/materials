# Change to grading weights


## With the midterm project

Final grades are calculated as weighted average of:

| Component | Weight |
|:-- | --:|
| Homework | 30% |
| Midterm | 25% |
| Midterm project | 15% |
| **Final Project** | |
|   report | 22.5% |
|   presentation | 7.5% |


## Without the midterm project

Final grades are calculated as weighted average of:

| Component | Weight |
|:-- | --:|
| Homework | 40% |
| Midterm | 25% |
| **Final Project** | |
|   report | 27.5% |
|   presentation | 7.5% |

## Without the midterm project

Calculate final points (out of 100) as:

| Component | Weight |
|:-- | --:|
| Homework | 40 x (hwk points + hwk extra credit)/100 |
| Midterm | 25 x (midterm pts + midterm extra credit)/100 |
| **Final Project** | |
|   report | 27.5 x (final project pts + extra credit)/100 |
|   presentation | 7.5 x (presentation pts + question pts)/44 |
| **Final Grade** | sum of above |

Letter grade not stricter than 90-80-70, likely more lenient
