# Solution to your turns

## An R package

- The package `yourturns-480` is available in form of a github repository 
- Install/Update the package with the command
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Stat480-at-ISU/yourturns480")
```
- You will need to update every couple of weeks (I will let you know)

## Run tutorials

- In order to start a set of your turns, use the command `run_tutorial` (from the `learnr` package). 
- The command below starts the tutorial set for logical variables and filters:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
learnr:: run_tutorial("logical", package="yourturns480")
```
