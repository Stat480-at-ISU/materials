# Welcome R

## Outline

- R is a calculator
- five commands to look at objects
- extracting pieces
- a first glimpse at data


## The R language

- Learning a new language: grammar, vocabulary
- Loading, examining, summarizing data
- Creating data
- Getting help
- Miscellaneous useful stuff

## Grammar

- Basic algebra is the same as calculator/mathematics
- explicit operators: `2*x` not `2x`,  `2^p` instead of `2p`
- Applying a function is similar 
- Making a variable, use `<-` or `=`
- Everything in R is a vector

## Examples

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
**Math** 

Assignments
$x = \frac{2}{3}$

Functions
$\sqrt{x}$

Vectors
$y = \left( 1, 2, 3, 5\right)^t$  

Indices
$y_1$

Mathematical Operators
$\sum_{i=1}^{4} y$

$2y$
</p><p class="double-flow">
**Code**

```
x <- 2/3
```

```
sqrt(x)
```

```
y <- c(1,2,3,5)
```

```
y[1]
```

```
sum(y)
```

```
2*y
```
</p>
</div>

- <span style="color:white">Introduce vector $x$ defined as $x = (4, 1, 3, 9)^t$</span>
- <span style="color:white">Introduce vector $x$ defined as  $y = (1, 2, 3, 5)^t$</span>
- <span style="color:white">Calculate the Euclidean distance between the two vectors $x$ and $y$, defined as 
\[
d = \sqrt(\sum_{i=1}^4 (x_i - y_i)^2)
\]
</span>


## Vocabulary 

- What verbs (=functions) do you need to know?
- Loading data
- Accessing parts of things
- Statistical summaries
- ...

## R Reference Card

- Download the R Reference Card from http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf
- Open/Print it so that you can glance at it while working



## Very basics

### Getting help within R

If you want to know what a specific `command` is doing:

```
?command
help(command) 
help.search(command)
```

### Getting out

```
q()
```
Quits out of the console


## Loading class data

- Some R packages have in-built datasets
- For this class, there is an R package available on github 
- Installing/Updating `classdata` package (once every so often):
```{r}
devtools::install_github("heike/classdata")
```
- Make the data available (every time you start R):
```{r}
library(classdata)
```


## Your Turn (5 min) {.white}

<img class="cover" src="images/blue.jpeg" alt="" width=2000>

<span style="color:white">Install the package `classdata` on your machine <br>
<span style="color:white">Make the package active in your current R session:
```
library(classdata)
```
<span style="color:white">Check the R help on the dataset `fbi`<br>
<span style="color:white">What happens if you just type in the name of the dataset?


## Inspecting objects

for object `x`, we can try out the following commands:

- ```x``` 
- ```head(x)```
- ```summary(x)```
- ```str(x)```
- ```dim(x)```


<font color="darkblue">Try these commands out for yourself on the `fbi` data.</font>

## The fbi data

- fbi is a data frame with columns (variables) and rows (records)

```{r}
str(fbi)
```

## Extracting parts of objects

For object `x`, we can extract parts in the following manner:

```
x$variable
x[, "variable"]
x[rows, columns]
x[1:5, 2:3]
x[c(1,5,6), c("State","Year")]
x$variable[rows]
```
`rows` and `columns` are vectors of indices.

## Statistical summaries

Elements of the five point summary: <br>
```mean, median, min, max, quartiles```<br>

Other summary statistics:<br>
```range, sd, var```<br>

Summaries of two variables:<br>
```cor, cov```

## Your turn {.white}

<img class="cover" src="images/blue.jpeg" alt="" width=2000>

- <span style="color:white">Look at the first 10 data records of the `fbi` data
- <span style="color:white">Compute mean and standard deviation for the number of counts. Why do you get NAs? (read `?NA`)
- <span style="color:white">Advanced:  Read `?mean` and `?sd`, and fix missing value problem
